# Project Proposal

## Avocado: The Study Space Tracker

### What and why?

**Problem Statement:** Across NYU and many other schools, finding a solid study spot on or around campus has become an impossible task. It is frustrating to walk all the way to the library or the commuter lounge and find that there are no empty seats, no free outlets or the chairs are too uncomfortable for a long study session. Because most school buildings are closed to the public, navigation services like Google Maps cannot track the "crowdedness" of on-campus study spaces like they do for subway stations or restaurants. In addition, Apple and Google Maps often do not provide information on the availability of outlets, water fountains, or bathrooms in public libraries or coffee shops, so students cannot make a fully informed decision on where to go to study, take a call or work on a group project.

Thus, the challenge is to create a mobile web application where students will be offered to check in at a study space (e.g. Bobst LL1, Think Coffee, 60 Fifth Avenue) and assess the "crowdedness" there. They can also log whether the location offers free amenities using a tag system as well as leave short comments like "sick for group projects" or "loud dudes in the back right now." Other students can then see in real time whether there might be space available at different locations. This app will ultimately optimize the selection of study spaces for students in real time and create a catalog of study spaces with ratings and specific details.

### Target users

The app will target college students, starting with NYU but potentially expanding to other schools. It will be especially useful for underclassmen who are new to campus.

### How?

Features:

1. **check-ins:** Users will have the choice to open the app and check in at their study location, so others can in turn see how many people are at the location in a given moment. The users will also be able to assess if the location is "very crowded," "crowded," "not too crowded" and "empty" -- this information will also be communicated to other users.
2. **interactive map:** Users will be able to see how many people have recently checked in at different locations around campus (including both school buildings and publicly accessible spaces, like coffee shops, libraries, and gardens) by using an interactive map with all the locations marked on it. It will also be possible to log a new location, which will in turn be marked a "hidden gem."
3. **amenities:** When checking in, students can also log the location's amenities - wifi, bathrooms, water, outlets etc. - by using a system of tags. 
4. **reports:** At the end of each month, there will be a report compiled ranking each study location by how many students checked in there. Locations with few check-ins but many amenities will be marked "hidden gems," while the most popular locations will be labeled with a warning about their "crowdedness."

### Scope

The proposal is not too easy due to its heavy reliance on JavaScript and real-time application, but not too challenging because there are only a handful of essential features and it is possible to limit the app's scope to just NYU New York campus.
